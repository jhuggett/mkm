# MakeMe (mkm)

Simple TUI that scans the current working directory for `Makefiles` and provide a pick list of commands. The selected command is run and the TUI exits. That is it.

To install, run `go install github.com/jhuggett/mkm@lates`.

To use, run `mkm` in a directory containing a `Makefile`.
